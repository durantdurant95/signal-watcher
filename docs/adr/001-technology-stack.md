# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) 001: Technology Stack

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Authors**: Signal Watcher Development Team

## Context

We need to build a full-stack security monitoring platform with AI integration that can:

- Handle security event ingestion and analysis
- Provide real-time monitoring capabilities
- Scale to handle enterprise workloads
- Integrate with AI services for intelligent analysis
- Support modern DevOps practices

## Decision

### Backend Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for event analysis
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0

### Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **Components**: Custom components with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks with Server Actions

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Package Manager**: pnpm for workspace management
- **Build Tool**: Native TypeScript compiler
- **Development**: tsx for hot reloading
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Docker (backend)
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

## Rationale

### Backend Choices

- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Unified language across stack, excellent AI library ecosystem
- **Express.js**: Mature, well-documented, extensive middleware ecosystem
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access, excellent PostgreSQL support, migration management
- **Redis**: High-performance caching, pub/sub capabilities for real-time features

### Frontend Choices

- **Next.js 14**: Server-side rendering, API routes, excellent developer experience
- **App Router**: Latest Next.js paradigm, better performance, improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS, rapid prototyping, consistent design system
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between frontend/backend, better developer experience

### AI Integration

- **OpenAI GPT-4**: State-of-the-art language model, excellent security analysis capabilities
- **Mock Mode**: Fallback for development and testing without API dependencies

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Unified TypeScript codebase improves maintainability
- ✅ Modern stack with excellent performance characteristics
- ✅ Strong typing reduces runtime errors
- ✅ Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- ✅ Production-ready scalability options

### Negative

- ❌ Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with modern stack
- ❌ OpenAI API dependency introduces external service risk
- ❌ Multiple deployment targets increase complexity

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive documentation and onboarding
- Mock AI mode for development and testing
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent deployments
- Monitoring and alerting for external dependencies

## Alternatives Considered

### Backend Alternatives

- **Python + FastAPI**: Excellent for ML/AI but team expertise in Node.js
- **Java + Spring Boot**: Enterprise-grade but slower development velocity
- **Go**: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem for AI integration

### Frontend Alternatives

- **React SPA**: Simpler but loses SSR benefits for SEO and performance
- **Vue.js**: Good framework but team expertise in React ecosystem
- **Svelte**: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem

### Database Alternatives

- **MongoDB**: Good for flexible schemas but SQL better for complex queries
- **MySQL**: Mature but PostgreSQL has better JSON and advanced features
- **SQLite**: Excellent for development but limited scalability

## Implementation Notes

### Workspace Structure

```
signal-watcher/
├── apps/
│   ├── backend/          # Express.js API
│   └── frontend/         # Next.js application
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/           # Shared TypeScript types
│   └── database/         # Prisma schema and migrations
└── docs/                 # Architecture and operational docs
```

### Development Workflow

1. Shared types in `packages/shared` ensure consistency
2. Database schema in `packages/database` with migrations
3. API in `apps/backend` with OpenAPI documentation
4. UI in `apps/frontend` with SSR and client-side features

This ADR will be reviewed and updated as the project evolves.
